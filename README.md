# Introduction To Digital Assets

Digital Assets represent anything that can be saved or tagged on the blockchain supported with a traceable and **unique** identifier. This in practice translates to many use-cases that can be seen in different industries (identity management, supply chain,  digital trading cards and collectibles, loyalty cards and fan tokens, proof of completion/ownership and many more).&#x20;

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) enable new types of collectible digital assets and a new infrastructure for blockchain-based unique items. **Non-Fungible tokens allow anyone to digitalize ownership of any arbitrary data**, while drastically increasing the design space and usability aspects of blockchain solutions \[[1](https://education.district0x.io/general-topics/understanding-ethereum/erc-721-tokens/)]. The biggest differentiator of Non-Fungible tokens versus "regular" tokens is that each one is tied to a different identifier, **making each token unique to its owner**.\
\
To support different industries and their use-cases we have developed a set of NFT-Core plugins and applications that enable us to quickly adapt and scale in related industry verticals.&#x20;

### Why Use Blockchain Together With Digital Asset (NFTs) Management?&#x20;

* Digital Assets (NFTs) enable the creation of rare & unique items that canâ€™t be destroyed, replicated or forged&#x20;
* NFTs can be tracked on the blockchain, providing an immutable history of the assets&#x20;
* NFTs cannot deteriorate over time. So when utilized in applications such as digital collectibles they do not deteriorate like their physical counterpart
* Peer-to-peer, secure trading enabled by blockchain technology&#x20;
* NFTs can be sold, and traded / exchanged back into Fiat

## Overview Of Digital Asset Management Process&#x20;

We developed a set of ARK Core plugins and SKDs that fully support Digital Asset management process,  from the creation and ownership to the interaction and trading part of digital assets.
